# Add Security Exception to APK

In Android 7.0, Google introduced changes to the way user Certificate Authorities (CA) are trusted. These changes prevent third-parties from listening to network requests coming out of the application:

This script injects into the APK network security exceptions that allow third-party software like Charles Proxy/Fiddler to listen to the network requests and responses of some Android applications.


## Getting Started

Download the script and the XML file and place them in the same directory.

### Prerequisites
1. APKTOOL is not needed anymore.

~~You will need `apktool` and the Android SDK installed~~

~~I recommend using `brew` on Mac to install `apktool`:~~

~~```brew install apktool```~~

2. Update line 52 with your username in addSecurityExceptions.sh

## Usage

The script take two arguments: 
1) APK file path.
2) keystore file path (**optional** - Default is: ~/.android/debug.keystore )

### Examples

```
./addSecurityExceptions.sh myApp.apk

or

./addSecurityExceptions.sh myApp.apk ~/.android/debug.keystore

```
